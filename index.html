            <p>Hi! My name is Dan Sprucek and I am a new web developer in the world! After years of working as a Project Manager and spending some time abroad I figured IT will be my next passion.</p>
            <p>I started with HTML/CSS/JS educational videos by <a href="https://www.mikedane.com/">Mike Dane</a>, who deserves a big credit for these. Next came a free 3 weeks course from <a href="https://www.greenfoxacademy.cz/">Greenfox Academy</a> deepening my HTML/CSS knowledge and adding jQuery to my skill portfolio. At the same time I also went through educational videos of PHP, Python and SQL (again kudos to Mike Dane) to understand the basics and be ready to deepen the skill when needed.</p>

            <h1>Work Experience</h1>
            <p>For my Work Experience in brief, please <span id="linkToDownloadCV">see my CV</span>.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, here is my full description of the work I did since my University studies:</p>
            <ul id="listOfJobs">
                <li><span>CZECH-IN (2012-2015)</span></li>
                <p>Back when I was in University finishing last year of my studies a friend of mine asked me if I was interested in a temp job. The whole work wasn't hard, simply filling out Visa applications and delivering them to the Alien Police. After a month they asked me if I would like to work for them full-time in Registration department. Since I've always had a good grasp of working with computers and programs it was a perfect match for me at that time. Mainly the job consisted of processing participants' registrations to various Conferences and Congresses, accommodation and subsequently being on-site. We used variety of programs such as <em>cmOffice</em>, <em>Eventsforce</em> or <em>Pohoda</em>. Over time I became a Deputy of the department.</p>
                <p>Highlight of my work was however another part of the job and that was managing transportation during one of the biggest Conferences that took place in Prague. There were over 5.000 participants, the event lasted for a whole week and it was just myself. Hundreds of transports including individual pendling from and to the airport/venue/hotel, buses to social gatherings and nearby cities (where I had to be present to organize the boarding) and last but not least high profile transport for the Board of the Association. It was a 4am - 1am job for 7 days straight but in the end it was a huge success.</p>
                <p>After my studies were over, I decided to work abroad. Via one of the contacts I gathered during working for CZECH-IN I secured a voluntary job as Administrator for <abbr title="International Conferedation of Midwives">ICM</abbr> in The Hague, Netherlands.</p>
                <li><span>ASTRIUM (NETHERLANDS) (2015)</span></li>
                <p>I started my Netherlands experience as a voluntary Administrator for a non-profit organization <abbr title="International Conferedation of Midwives">ICM</abbr>. After 2 weeks I secured a job interview for Astrium company as a Billing Assistant. This company was a major accountant for call and broadband services used on the sea by both big companies such as Maersk and private ships. My role was helping other colleagues - Accountants - with minor tasks at first.</p>
                <p>However, they soon realized I can handle quite an amount of work in a short time and I don't make mistakes, so they gave me a search-and-charge job supporting all the Accountants. This job consisted of searching for unbilled services, finding the right account and charge them. Sometimes these amounts were quite low like a few pounds, but summed up there were thousands of pounds every month that would otherwise be forgotten.</p>
                <p>Living in The Hague was great and if I will ever decide to retire in another country than Czech Republic, I believe Netherlands will be amongst my top choices. At the end of the year 2015 I had personal reasons to go back to Czech Republic however and although Astrium offered me a job as a full Accountant, I had to decline.</p>
                <li><span>WUNDERMAN (2015-2016)</span></li>
                <p>I looked for a job in Czech Republic even before I moved back from The Hague and sent out loads of applications. I remember replying to Wunderman with a feeling that I am underqualified for the job of Project Manager (mainly experience in Marketing), but I thought I would leave it up to them to decide. It turned out to be a good choice since I got the job and started working in one of the friendliest environments.</p>
                <p>The biggest challenges in Wunderman were get used to all the jargon that is used in Marketing and Online Media in particular. Learning <em>Jira</em> (and <em>Confluence</em>), the Project Tracking Software, was essential as this was the main software used to communicate with both clients and the internal team. I was one of many Project Managers who worked for a single client - Ford Motor Company. We received requests for online advertisement from most of Europe, clarified all the details (which was the most time consuming part) and then briefed it to our internal team of art directors, designers, deverlopers etc.</p>
                <p>After almost one year of satisfied job (from both sides) I decided to move abroad again - this time with my partner - and since we weren't lucky in getting visa to Canada, we chose Edinburgh in Scotland/UK as our destination. Our vision was to spend there 1 to 3 years.</p>
                <li><span>APARTHOTEL ADAGIO (UK) (2016-2017)</span></li>
                <p>Scotland is quite a country to move to. Although my dominant language was English throughout my entire job experience and I consider myself fluent, talking to Scottish people took some getting used to. For a foreigner with not much IT skills the only viable option were services. I've done some bartending before finally landing a job in a newly opened Adagio Aparthotel as a Night Auditor. This position basically consisted of a Night Receptionist and Auditor. Unlike most businesses hotels never have <abbr title="End of Business">EOD</abbr>. Since the quitest time in hotel is between 3am and 4am, when those who enjoyed an evening out are already back and early birds are not up yet, that's when the "closing" takes place. Everything must be balanced before this time and Adagio used <em>FOLS</em> program to achieve that together with all check-in/out and reservations.</p>
                <p>After 2 months of spending 4 nights working and 3 nights sleeping (plus 16 straight night shifts due to my colleague illness) I had enough. I requested to be transferred to the day shift. Right after I trained the new night shift I started working during the day which was a great benefit for the Hotel. There were number of struggles between the night and day shifts but no one to fix them since no one knew about each other's responsibilities. I could finally understand the whole process and served as a messenger or "translator". Day shift was almost the same as night with many more check-in/outs and calls minus the auditting.</p>
                <p>If it weren't for Scottish weather (neverending wind, almost no sun and kind of the same cold all the time) I might have stayed longer. I was finally started getting offers for better jobs, when we decided with my partner it was time to move back to Czech Republic and settle down.</p>
                <li><span>WUNDERMAN THOMPSON (2017-2020)</span></li>
                <p>Here I was back in Czech Republic looking for a job and the obvious thought came up - applying for my old job as a Project Manager in Wunderman. Since I had a lot of contacts and left on a good terms, it took one meeting to get it back.The main software used was still <em>Jira</em> and most of the work was still the same. Around a year after the Company merged with J. Walter Thompson to create Wunderman Thompson.</p>
                <p>As the time passed the number of Project Managers dwindled. With our second to most senior Project Manager gone I started working much more closely with our most important client in London. I also worked more closely with the QA team and developers (around this time I also began interested in web development). After a year I was promoted to Senior Project Manager.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately we didn't agree on the terms related to the promotion and I left the company - just before the Coronavirus outbreak.</p>
                <li><span>SELF-EDUCATION (April 2020-present)</span></li>
                <p>At my last day in Wunderman Thompson I came to empty offices with just a couple of persons from IT and HR to greet new employees or as in my case, to say goodbye to the former ones. Coronavirus was about to hit Czech Republic and the government declared a state of emergency and implemented quarantine measures to reduce the spread. I figured this was a perfect opportunity to learn a new skill and web development was something I dreamt of lately.</p>
                <p>I was told that HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the basics everyone has to know, so I started with w3schools.com and Giraffe Academy (namely Mike Dane) study materials. I created a few websites and applications when I heard about Greenfox Academy offering a free course beginner web developers. I enlisted instantly and two days later began a 3-weeks course. At the start it wasn't challenging enough and I wanted to learn more so I went back to Mike Dane's page and studied the basics of PHP, Python and SQL.</p>
                <p>After 3 weeks of course (where I deepened my HTML/CSS knowledge and discovered jQuery) I decided to create this website since the only way how to learn is experience. I also read that reactJS is quite popular and good to have skill for a web developer, so I started learning it at freecodecamp.org.</p>
